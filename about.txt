Starting a house renting startup can be a great venture, especially in today's market where many people are looking for flexible living arrangements. Here are some ideas to consider:

1. Online Platform: Create a user-friendly website or app where landlords can list their properties and tenants can easily search for rentals based on their preferences such as price, location, and amenities.

2. Virtual Tours: Incorporate virtual tours of the properties to give potential renters a better idea of what they are renting without having to visit in person, making the process more convenient.

3. Rental Management Services: Offer services for landlords that include managing their properties, handling tenant inquiries, and maintenance requests. This can streamline the renting process for both parties.

4. Flexible Lease Options: Provide flexible lease terms that cater to different needs, such as short-term rentals for travelers or longer leases for families.

5. Community Building: Create a platform that not only focuses on renting but also helps build a community among tenants, offering local events, meet-ups, or social media groups.

6. Sustainability Focus: Promote eco-friendly properties or those with sustainable practices, as many renters today are looking for green living options.

7. Personalized Matching: Use algorithms or quizzes to match tenants with properties based on their lifestyle preferences, making the search more efficient.

These ideas can help you create a unique value proposition in the house renting market.
